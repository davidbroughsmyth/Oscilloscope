Simple Oscilloscope Simulator 

All switches and knobs of the oscilloscope and frequency generators can be 
controlled with the mouse wheel or by right/left click.

The simulated frequency generators are floating voltage sources. 
The frequency generators have therefore no hidden connection to oscilloscope ground.
